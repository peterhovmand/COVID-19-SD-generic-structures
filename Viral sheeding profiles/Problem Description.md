# Problem Description
There is some evidence that the viral shedding profile for COVID-19 is strongest right around the time of symptom onset. Most models assume infectious or not depending on the stock. It is unclear how much this will distort our ability to understand disease dynamics for COVID-19.

There are some clear solutions to this problem - but no examples as of the writing of this problem statement.
