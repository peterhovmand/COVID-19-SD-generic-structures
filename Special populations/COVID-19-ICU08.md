# Approach
This is a draft model that represents health care workers using a parallel chain of disease stage, but does not separate them from the genereal population. That is, the health care workers are part of the full population, but are moved though the different disease stages at a different rate because they are likely to have higher exposure.

#Shortcomings
Because this is not an MECE (mutually exclusing collectively exhuastive) representation of the populations it runs the risck for double or undercounting individuals in the special population. This is an examply of clarity and simplicity being chosen in favor of exactness.
