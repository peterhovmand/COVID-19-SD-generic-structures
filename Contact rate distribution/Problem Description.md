# Problem Description

Most models have single parameter for contact rate, but that parameter combines people who have very little contact with those who have a great deal. This is not usually a huge issue, since we are looking at broad averages anyway, but when there are social distancing interventions we change both the average value, and the distribution of values. Put another way, an individual that is hightly socialized with a large number of interactions may continue with that large number even while others are curtailing contact. 

This changing distribution will affect aggregate disease spread, and may also concentrate the spread in sub-populations based on their sociability (or living conditions).
