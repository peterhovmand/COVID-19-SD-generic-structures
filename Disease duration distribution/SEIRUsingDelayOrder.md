# Approach
While a first order delay iss effectively a negative exponential distribution, higher order delays look more like a modal distribution. This model uses Nth order delays to look at the implications for disease spread. When N is 1, it is the same as the standard SEIR model, When N is quite large, it is largely the same as a model using conveyors.

#Shortcomings
The outflows to quarinteening (or tested) are more complicated to compute and maintain consistency (the mutually exclusive collectively exhuastive MECE nature of the stocks because harder to maintain).
