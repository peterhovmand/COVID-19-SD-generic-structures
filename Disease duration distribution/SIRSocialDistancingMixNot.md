# Approach
Use conveyors, or conveyors with a distribution of delay, as the basis for holding people in the infected (and contagious) stock. This model has modules with both perfect mixing and the conveyors. Note how much different the contact rate needs to be between the two in order to get roughly the same behavior. It is also interesting to see the different in response to social distancing interventions. 

#Shortcomings
This model is really just an illustration.

NOTE - this model requires Stella Version 2.0. For earlier Stella versions delete the module Not Mixing.
