# Problem Description
Many variations of susceptible-infectious disease models assume perfect mixing between people who are susceptible and people who are infected. However, the problem is that there is not perfect mixing in the real world and it is important to be able to know when the perfect mixing assumption matters and what can be done. 

# Approach
This is a rebuild of the Imperial College model using conveyors and splitting those who are infected and symptomatic from those who are asymptomatic.
