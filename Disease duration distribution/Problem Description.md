# Problem Description
Many variations of susceptible-infectious disease models assume perfect mixing between people who are susceptible and people who are infected. However, the problem is that there is not perfect mixing in the real world and it is important to be able to know when the perfect mixing assumption matters and what can be done. 

This is especially true of COVID-19 because it has such a long duration. The perfect mixing models effectively assume that most people are in the infectious state for only a very short period of time, while others remain for a very long time. The different in behvior between perfect micing and not is remarkable in this case.
