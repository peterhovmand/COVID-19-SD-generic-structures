# Approach
Identify the two different types of assymptomatic by explicitly modeling the disease progression (the standard SEIR model uses this), and also categorize severity of symptoms, including an assymptomatic severity.  The model does a little bit further than SEIR in identifying exposed but not contagious, assymptomatic and contagious, then symptomatic and contagius. For people in the assymptomatic severity category there is no noticable different in the different states.

#Shortcomings
Not so much a shortcoming as a possibility, but identifyin which people will fall into which severyt catetory based on demographic information can help in understanding health care needs.
