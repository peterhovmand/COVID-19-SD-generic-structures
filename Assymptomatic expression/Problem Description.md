# Problem Description

Rresponding to an outbreak with some people displaying no symptoms is much more difficult than an infectious disease in which everyone who is contagious is clearly sick. There are two ways that people can be assymptomatic. They can be in early stages of the infection and not yet showing symptoms, or they can simply never notice that they are infected.

COVID-19 seems to have both of these types of assymptomatic expression, but it is not well understood how long (before symptoms) or how many (without symptoms). How infectious is also another unknown, though there does seem to be good evidence that there is high virus shedding just as symptoms first appear.
