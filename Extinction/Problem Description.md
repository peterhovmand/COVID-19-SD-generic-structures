# Problem Description

Eradicating a disease requires that the (normallly) virus causing the disease become extinct in the wild (more precisely in people for COVID-19).This is very difficult to accomplish. It happened for Smallpox, MERS, SARS, and arguably (instances of) Ebola. It has not happened for Polio or Malaria despite early optimism, and certainly not the flu or common cold.

When a continuous model runs there can be tiny numbers of people that carry the disease that will casuse the disease to reappear as a full blown epidemic. This can, and does, happen in the real world. But it is also possible to sufficiently isolate carriers so that the virus can no longer be foound anywhere (MERS, SARS). This isolation is an error prone process best represented using stocastic assumptions. When only a few people are left as carriers how can a continuous model provide for the possibility of extinction?
