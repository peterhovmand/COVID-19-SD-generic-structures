# Approach
This is a (probably too) simple approach that identifies a theshold below which extinction occurs (as long as people are aware of the disease - otherwise there would never be an outbreak). This model contains a discrete and mixed population (see Disease duration distribution) as well as an agent based modules. The agent based module is stochastic, and will give different results every time. The other two modules will always give the same results.

#Shortcomings
Probably a little too simply minded. It is likely also that the threshold will need to be adjusted depending on the mixing assumption. In the base run for this model with perfect mixing there is no extinction - using conveyors (a fixed disease duration) there is extinction. The agent based model usually shows extinction.
